## 4. Sample Responses

### User Input:
> “I was charged twice for my monthly subscription. Can I get a refund?”



### Response using Refined Prompt

> "I understand your concern about the double charge for your monthly subscription. If you were charged twice for the same billing period, you're typically eligible for a refund of the duplicate transaction.  
>  
> To proceed, please confirm the transaction IDs or the approximate dates of the charges. Once verified, our billing team will initiate the refund to your original payment method within 5–7 business days.  
>  
> Let me know if you need help locating those transaction details in your account dashboard."



### Response using CoT-Enhanced Prompt

> “Let’s break this down:  
>  
> 1. You're reporting two charges for your monthly subscription, which may indicate a duplicate billing event.  
> 2. Our billing policy states that in cases of accidental duplicate charges, a full refund is issued for the extra transaction.  
> 3. To confirm this, we’ll need the dates or receipts for both charges.  
>  
> Here's what you can do:  
> • Log in to your account and go to the Billing > Transaction History section.  
> • Look for two identical charges with the same description.  
> • Share their dates or reference numbers.  
>  
> Once we have those, we can validate the duplicate and initiate your refund within 5–7 business days. Thank you for your patience!”
