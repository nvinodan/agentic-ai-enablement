| Model              | Criteria        | Rating                         | Comments                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GPT-4o**         | Code Quality    | **Excellent**                | Produces clean, idiomatic code with proper comments and explanations. Handles complex logic well. |
|                   | SQL Generation  | **Excellent**                | Great at writing optimized queries with JOINs, subqueries, and indexing suggestions. |
|                   | Ease of Use     | **Excellent**                | Well-documented, easily available via OpenAI API. Natural language prompts work seamlessly. |
|                   | Speed/Latency   | **Good**                     | Slight latency in large payloads; acceptable for most dev workflows.    |
| **Claude Sonnet**  | Code Quality    | **Excellent**                | Strong context understanding. Generates modular, readable code. Great with TypeScript/Python. |
|                   | SQL Generation  | **Good**                     | Handles most SQL cases well, but occasionally verbose or misses edge cases. |
|                   | Ease of Use     | **Excellent**                | Available via Anthropic API. Works well with structured prompt templates. |
|                   | Speed/Latency   | **Excellent**                | Very responsive, especially in Claude 3 API tier.                        |
| **Gemini Flash**   | Code Quality    | **Good**                     | Produces usable code but needs validation. Sometimes includes outdated syntax. |
|                   | SQL Generation  | **Good**                     | Understands SQL basics; struggles with advanced optimizations or dialect-specific queries. |
|                   | Ease of Use     | **Excellent**                | Google AI Studio and API access are smooth. Good UI/UX.                  |
|                   | Speed/Latency   | **Excellent**                | One of the fastest response times among the models tested.              |
| **DeepSeek-R1:7B** (Ollama) | Code Quality    | **Good**                     | Solid for basic code patterns (loops, conditionals, API stubs). May need polishing. |
|                   | SQL Generation  |  **Basic or Limited Support** | Can generate simple SELECT queries; struggles with complex joins or filters. |
|                   | Ease of Use     | **Good**                     | Local setup required; REST API works well via Ollama but needs infra config. |
|                   | Speed/Latency   | **Excellent**                | Very fast locally once model is loaded. Zero network dependency.        |
